# Various-Boltzmann
Variation of Boltzmann Machines implemented in Matlab.
All the codes is based on "https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox.git".
These codes has implemented a RBM's training mathods in terms of the paper "Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines via the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer Free Energy" by matlab.In the course of implementation,I also reference to the Julia language version codes "https://github.com/sphinxteam/Boltzmann.jl".
